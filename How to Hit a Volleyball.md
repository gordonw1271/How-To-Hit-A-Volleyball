##### 3. Approach
   - Begin your approach when the ball is in the setters hands

   - Many people use either a 3 or 4 step approach, it all comes down to preference
   > Right handed hitters should finish their approach with their left foot and left handed hitters with their right foot.
   > Therefore, a right handed hitter's step order, using a 3 step approach would go left, right left.

   - Your last two steps should be quick and close together. This will allow you to be explosive and jump your highest

   - Create a small knot at the end of the thread
