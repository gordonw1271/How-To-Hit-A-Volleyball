---
### Materials
---

- Volleyball

   > There are different sizes of Aida. Size 14 is standard for beginners. Higher numbers will create a smaller pattern.

- Volleyball net

- Setter

### Steps
---
##### 1. Positioning
   - The hitter (you) should be on the left side of the court, behind the 10 foot line 

   - The setter should be towards the middle of the net

##### 2. Toss

   - Toss the ball up to the setter so that the setter can contact the ball above his/her head
   - Wait for setter to set the ball

##### 3. Approach
   - Begin your approach when the ball is in the setters hands

   - Many people use either a 3 or 4 step approach, it all comes down to preference
   > Right handed hitters should finish their approach with their left foot and left handed hitters with their right foot.
   > Therefore, a right handed hitter's step order, using a 3 step approach would go left, right left.

   - Once the ball is set and in the air, approach towards the ball

   - Your last two steps should be quick and close together. This will allow you to be explosive and jump your highest

##### 4. Jump
   - After the last two steps of your approach, explode and jump up
   - swing your arms to generate momentum in order to jump higher

##### 5. Vision
   - Once you are in the air, use your peripheral vision to see where the block is. This will let you know where you should hit the ball

##### 6. Contact
   - Where you contact the ball will dictate where it will go
   - The two main areas you can swing are line and cross
    > To hit line, contact the ball on the top right and swing accross your body
   > To hit cross, contact the ball on the top left
